2024 marked one of the most transformative years in BTCPay Server's seven-year journey. Here we highlight our key achievements showcasing the progress made and detailing ambitions for the year ahead, that ensure BTCPay Server continues to lead the way in empowering merchants, developers, activists and [local communities](https://btcpayserver.org/bitcoin-2024-the-year-of-ambassadors/) to embrace Bitcoin as a medium of exchange.

## Our Mission

We empower individuals and businesses with tools to accept Bitcoin payments directly, eliminating trusted third parties and fees. By creating open-source, privacy-focused infrastructure, we provide merchants, developers, and community leaders with solutions that break down geographic, political, and financial barriers, driving the global adoption of Bitcoin.

## Our Vision

We want to help transform the global financial landscape and make Bitcoin the universal standard for payments. We aim to lead by example in this evolution by fostering innovation and adoption through open-source, censorship-resistant, and self-custodial technologies, building a future where tools for financial freedom are accessible to all.

## Looking ahead to 2025

As we move into 2025, our key priorities are centered on driving Bitcoin adoption in commerce, expanding the core team, and fortifying our plugin ecosystem. We aim to deliver three major releases of BTCPay Server (2.1.0 to 2.3.0), alongside regular minor updates to ensure stability and performance. 

The BTCPay App will see significant progress, with a closed beta planned by Q2 and an open beta by Q4, bringing non-custodial lightning closer to retail merchants. Our efforts will also include six new e-commerce integrations and a redesigned plugin store to enhance user experience. All of these efforts should culminate with a redesigned btcpayserver.org ensuring proper 

On the community front, we will focus on empowering ambassadors through educational materials, multilingual support, and community-building initiatives. Our educational strategy will include launching a new documentary, publishing case studies,enhancing documentation and participating in major industry events to increase projects visibility. 

To ensure sustainability, we will strengthen our financial position by trying to find new funding sources, optimizing donation channels, and expanding our core team with at least 3 more developers to meet growing demands.

[Miro link to the roadmap here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLrC8ouY=/?share_link_id=493896409708)

#### **Q1: Laying the foundation**

In the first quarter of 2025, we will focus on strengthening the team and establishing a solid foundation for the year. A key priority will be the recruitment and onboarding of new developers for both the BTCPay App and BTCPay Server, ensuring a stable team structure and clear ownership of key project areas. BTCPay Server 2.1.0 is scheduled for release, bringing multi-sig wallet improvements, new plugins, and transitioning XMR and ZEC integrations into community-maintained plugins. This shift allows the core team to remain focused on Bitcoin while reducing the burden of maintaining external projects. At the same time, the BTCPay App will move closer to closed beta testing, with advancements in authentication refactoring, manual backup, and new device pairing functionality. We’re confident that we’ll ship at least 2 new integrations with popular e-commerce platforms further enlarging the user base.

#### **Q2: App closed-beta and monetization for admins**

In Q2, BTCPay Server 2.2.0 will ship, focusing on membership plugins,ensuring monetization options for server hosts. Furthermore we want to improve server reporting, and redesign the plugin store. For the BTCPay App, we aim to finalize LSP integration and restore functionality while initiating closed beta testing with users who host BTCPay for local communities. On the integration front, we will add compatibility with platforms like Cal.com, Salesforce, and GetPaid (WP), opening new opportunities for merchants. Alongside these updates, new plugins like the rate fallback plugin will further enhance the merchant experience by allowing them to have a safe net in case one of the price sources goes offline.

#### **Q3: Expanding features and usability**

In the third quarter, our focus shifts to expanding features and improving usability. BTCPay Server 2.3.0 will introduce key updates such as admin default settings for user time zones and possible LSP integration for server users, alongside improvements to the plugin store. On the BTCPay App side, we’ll be testing and iterating on the feedback gathered from the closed beta phase, ensuring the app is running without critical bugs, while ensuring all feedback is logged in GitHub. New integrations, including SquareSpace (we still need to research the likelihood of integration) and additional plugins like the Cashu plugin, will strengthen our offering for merchants and users. Educational efforts will focus on Bitcoin for corporations and scaling ambassador communities.

#### **Q4: Polishing and open beta**

The final quarter of the year will be dedicated to stabilizing and polishing. BTCPay Server minor releases in that period will focus on removing outdated features from the core codebase while maintaining and improving existing integrations. The BTCPay App will enter its open beta testing phase, marking a significant milestone in our journey to make non-custodial Bitcoin payments more accessible for physical stores worldwide. This quarter will also feature a revamped website launch to showcase our evolving product range to the adequate user-groups.
