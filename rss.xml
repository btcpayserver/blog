It’s intuitive enough that anyone can use it, while having the depth needed to satisfy more advanced users. It’s stable enough to deploy without constant worrying, yet innovate enough to continue adding new features without making the product worse overall.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Nearly all other Bitcoin commerce solutions have some custodial KYC component. This is something that we wish to avoid at Voltage. With those services put aside, the competition for Bitcoin native commerce platforms that are open source is relatively slim. BTCPay Server’s core ethos and mission align perfectly with our own, and that made the choice to use BTCPay Server fairly easy. On top of that, the sheer amount of features and customizability of BTCPay Server is unmatched in the industry.]]></description>

The sheer volume of transactions they funneled through BTCPay in the initial month could have easily overwhelmed previous systems. But BTCPay Server and its dedicated team, spearheaded by Nicolas, were more than capable. They were deeply committed to resolving any new issues that cropped up, fine-tuning the system for scalability, and quickly rolling out updates, all of which ensured that Coincards ran smoothly with hardly any interruptions.]]></description>
